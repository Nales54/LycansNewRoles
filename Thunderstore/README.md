## Résumé

- 5 rôles "solo" qui ne sont ni avec les villageois ni avec les loups : ils gagnent seuls et ont un objectif spécifique

- 7 nouveaux effets de potions : Midas, Assassin, Minuscule, Vampire, Hanté, Surdité, Myopie
- Augmentation du maximum de joueurs à 15, possibilité de mettre 3 loups et jusqu'à 3000 de récolte à atteindre...

- Une option pour pouvoir désarmer les pièges et leur donner un petit délai de pose
- Une option de vote aléatoire
- Une option pour choisir les effets de potions possibles et les gadgets disponibles
- Une option pour pouvoir poser son objet au sol (ne fonctionne pas avec les balles pour des raisons d'équilibrage)

- Presque tout est configurable : vous pouvez ajouter les nouveautés progressivement ou retirer ce qui ne vous plait pas
- Des bugs sont toujours possibles mais le mod est testé depuis un bon moment sur le Discord officiel

Merci à Timaki pour les images avec les descriptions !

## Rôles secondaires
Les rôles secondaires sont donnés en plus du rôle principal, par exemple "Villageois - Hurleur". La plupart de leurs pouvoirs actifs ont un temps de recharge.

Ils ne sont pas spécifiques aux villageois ni aux loups : sauf exception, n'importe quel rôle secondaire peut être attribué à n'importe qui.

## Rôles solo
Les rôles solo ne sont ni dans le camp des villageois, ni dans le camp des loups : ils gagnent seuls et ont un objectif spécifique.

1 seul rôle solo sera glissé parmi les joueurs.

## Traître
Le traître est humain et ne peut donc pas se transformer, mais il est du côté des loups. Il peut aussi recevoir un pouvoir de loup.

## Pouvoirs de loups
En plus du rôle secondaire, les loups et le traître peuvent recevoir un pouvoir de loup. Un loup peut ainsi être "Loup Sorcier - Téléporteur" : Sorcier est son pouvoir, et Téléporteur est son rôle secondaire.

## Nouveaux effets de potions

## Sabotages
- Les objets sabotables indiquent leur nom quand vous les regardez. Si vous êtes Loup ou Traître vous verrez aussi un compteur, par exemple "1/3".

- Seuls les Loups et le Traître peuvent saboter. On peut saboter de jour comme de nuit, mais seulement en forme humaine.

- Chaque sabotage est relié à plusieurs objets du jeu, par exemple le sabotage "Puits empoisonnés" est lié aux puits de chaque village.

- Si suffisamment d'objets ont été sabotés, le sabotage lié se déclenche en début de nuit, et tout le monde est averti.

- Les objets sabotés restent sabotés d'un jour sur l'autre, sauf si leur sabotage lié s'est déclenché pendant la nuit.

- Vous pouvez par exemple saboter 2 puits pendant la première journée, puis le troisième puits pendant la deuxième journée, pour déclencher le sabotage à la deuxième nuit.

## Nouveaux objets
- Parchemin : il est associé à un effet négatif aléatoire. Visez un joueur et utilisez l'objet (avec la touche habituelle) pour lui infliger l'effet !

## Secondary roles (given in addition to the main role)
* Most active powers for secondary roles have a cooldown

Howler: He can increase the range of his voice and slow down nearby people while he's talking. If he's in Wolf form, he will instead stun ALL villagers and slow them down.

Alcoholic: Negative and neutral potion effects are replaced with random positive ones. He can use his power to change a gadget (such as traps) into a potion. In addition, an Alcoholic Wolf can take and drink potions while in Wolf form to heal himself!

Detective: He can Inspect someone to know whether they've killed since the latest night (or, if he's a Wolf, to know their roles). In addition, he knows who the Hunter is.

Sprinter: He can activate Sprint at will to become faster, but this rapidly drains his hunger bar. In addition, a Sprinter Wolf can, in wolf form, Chase to get really fast for a short moment.

Infected: If he's a Villager and is killed by a Wolf, he forces that Wolf to untransform after a while (the Wolf is notified of this). If he's a Wolf, in wolf form, he can Infect nearby villagers to make them fart and find them more easily!

Teleporter: He can set up an invisible beacon, then at any time he can teleport to it after a 3 seconds delay.

Engineer: He can create a random gadget. In addition, traps have less duration on him and he disarms them faster, he breaks locks faster, and smoke bombs have a lower radius for him.

Stealther: In human form, he can become Stealthed to be invisible and have silent footsteps, but he can't run in this state. In Wolf form he instead becomes undetectable (no scary effect).

Politician: During daytime, he can force a player to pass for their next vote. In addition, if he's a Villager his vote counts double and if he would be voted out then someone else dies instead!

Metabolic: If he's a Villager, any food he loots will heal him for more health. If he's a Wolf, he can secretly mark someone during the day to make them starve during the next night!

Illusionist: If he's a Villager, he can blind all transformed Wolves for a short time. If he's a Wolf, he can shuffle the appearence of all players!

Sherif: Using a bullet, he can attempt to kill someone... but if their target is on the Villager side, then the Sherif dies instead! In addition, a Sherif Wolf is slightly resistant to bullets and can still run for a few seconds after being hit by one.

Trickster: He can switch his position with a random player's. In addition, if he dies, there's a chance that another random player also dies.

Medium: He's warned everytime a player dies, and he knows the specific Wolf roles. If he's a Wolf, he also knows everyone's secondary role.

Astral: His action range (opening doors, looting items) is increased, including his kill and sabotage range if he's a Wolf. He can also project his mind to analyze the situation from up, like a Giant potion's effect, but this consumes some health.

## New primary roles
### Solo roles (a single one will be assigned)
Village Idiot: He wins if he get's voted out during a meeting. He gets hungry slower but staying inactive makes him very hungry.

Cannibal: He can eat corpses (even Wolf corpses) and he wins if he eats enough of them. They give him the Satiated effect, and he cannot eat while Satiated.

Agent: If this solo role is picked, there will be two agents. They can identify each other and also identify Wolves. Each Agent can eliminate the other. He wins by being amongst the last 2 or 3 survivors at the start or end of a meeting, provided the other Agent is dead.

Spy: He gets targets to spy on (red name in the player list) and wins if he manages to Spy enough times.

Scientist: He wins by attaining 100% Research. His Research increases by being close to a transformed Wolf, or by witnessing a Wolf kill or transformation. More effective if he's close and if the Wolf is visible and not starving.

### Special role
Traitor: He's a perfectly ordinary human... but he sides with the Wolves.

### Wolf roles
Necromancer: Once only, during a night, he can resurrect a targeted corpse. This player becomes a Wolf who transforms immediately, but he's mute and dies when the night ends.

Shapeshifter: He can freely choose a player and disguise himself as them. His human form is changed until the next meeting.

Deceiver: If he's present, illusions of transformations will be created through the night, confusing the villagers.

Tracker: In Wolf form, he's a little slower than other Wolves, but his vision hints him on nearby player proximity: the redder, the closer.

Enraged: In Wolf form, he's faster than other Wolves, but he gets hungry at a faster rate and his health keeps decreasing even when low. If it reaches zero, he untransforms.

Warlock: Once per day during daytime, he can curse someone to transform them into Wolf form during the night. However their actual role does not change and they cannot kill.

Possessor: He can freely choose a player and see through their eyes. The target is warned of this, and they cannot run while Possessed.

Saboteur: He can see items (gadgets and potions) more easily, and he can secretly sabotage them while they're on the ground or held by someone. A player attempting to use a sabotaged item will have a nasty surprise!

## Sabotages
- Objects that can be sabotaged show their name when you look at them. Si you're a Wolf or Traitor you also see a counter, such as "1/3"

- Only Wolves and Traitors can sabotage. They can sabotage during the day or night, but only in human form.

- Each sabotage is linked to several objects in the game, for example the "Poisoned wells" sabotage is linked to the well of each village.

- If enough objects have been sabotaged, the linked sabotage is triggered when the night starts, and everyone is warned of it.

- Sabotaged objects stay sabotaged between each day, unless their sabotage has been triggered during the night.

- For example you can sabotage 2 wells during the first day, then the third during the second day, and the sabotage will be triggered during the following night.

### List of sabotages and their objects and effects:
Map 1 (villages)
- Poisoned wells: the well in each of the 3 villages. Slowly reduces health and slightly slows down all players.
- Eternal night: the wood pile near the church, the 4 pillars at the ruins, and the cauldron near the fishermens' village. Increases night length and reduces Wolf hunger.
- Portals: the 4 portals in the map (only need to sabotage 3 of them). Greatly reduces Portal cooldown and only allows transformed Wolves to use them.

Map 2 (castle)
- Poisoned wells: the two wells in town, the well behind the castle, and the fountain in front of the castle. Slowly reduces health and slightly slows down all players.
- Cursed night: the book in the town church, the notice board next to the spawn, and the book in the room at the top of the castle. Increases fog and casts negative effects on random non-transformed players.

## New potion effects
- Midas (positive): multiplies loot value by 4.

- Assassin (positive): under this effect you can kill a player in human form or a wounded Wolf, or paralyze a non-wounded Wolf. The effect is then lost.

- Tiny (neutral): you become tiny. Useful to escape a Wolf, but there's a certain logical risk involved...

- Vampire (neutral): you gradually steal the health of all players in a large radius.

- Haunted (neutral): random and unexpected effects!

- Deaf (negative): you no longer hear anything, not even the presence of Wolves...

- Nearsight (negative): your vision is heavily reduced by fog.

## New items
- Scroll: it is linked to a random negative effect. Aim at a player and use it (with the usual key) to inflict them with that effect!
